    rake checkstyle      # Check the style of the source
    rake clean           # Removes the build path
    rake compile         # Compiles Java class files to the target
    rake dist            # Copies files required for distribution to the dist...
    rake docs            # Create javadoc documentation
    rake jar             # Generates Java archive file
    rake resources       # Copies resource files to the target
    rake serialver       # Generate serial version UIDs
    rake test            # Runs unit tests
    rake test:compile    # Compiles test Java class files to the test target
    rake test:resources  # Copies test resource files to the test target
    rake test:run        # Runs unit tests

## TODO

This project was extracted from a large Java project where more flexibility was
needed than is offered with [ant](http://ant.apache.org "Ant").  Some of the
tasks were created specifically to fill the needs of the project and can be
made to suit a more general purpose.
